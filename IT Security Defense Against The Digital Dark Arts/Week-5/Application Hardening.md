## Application Hardening

### Question 1

Why is it important to keep software up-to-date? 

It's not important. 

To ensure compatibility with other systems

To ensure access to the latest features

To address any security vulnerabilities discovered ( Correct )

Answer - As vulnerabilities are discovered and fixed by the software vendor, applying these updates is super important to protect yourself against attackers.


### Question 2

What types of software are typically blacklisted? Select all that apply.

Video games  ( Correct )

File Sharing software ( Correct )

Web browsers

Answer - Video games and file sharing software typically don't have a use in business (though it does depend on the nature of the business). So, it might make sense to have explicit policies dictating whether or not this type of software is permitted on systems.


### Question 3

What does applying software patches protect against?   

Undiscovered vulnerabilities & newly found vulnerabilities ( Correct )

Suspicious network traffic.

MITM attacks 

Data tampering 

Answer - Software updates or patches can fix recently discovered vulnerabilities or close ones that you weren't aware of.


### Question 4

What should be considered when implementing software policies and guidelines?

The local weather forecast

Your reputation within the company

What the users need in order to do their jobs ( Correct )

The company’s technical debt

Answer - If there's a common use case for a certain type of software, it would be helpful to select a specific software implementation and require the use of that solution.


### Question 5

What is one way to check whether or not a website can be trusted?

The webpage design

Check for SSL certificates ( Correct )

The quality of pictures on the website
